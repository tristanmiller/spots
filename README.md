pump operation simulator

The idea behind all of this is to create a fire pump simulation that can be used in various ways for training/staff development.
There are two main components:

1/a physics model that can solve pressures and flows around a dynamic network, with plausible results, in real time.
2/a collection of different scenarios/front-ends that harness this physics model in different ways

The scenarios are just different interfaces to the same physics model, that are designed to meet different needs and audiences.
These presentations could include challenge-based pump panel operations, interactive schematics, animated interactives in articles, really this is limited by the imagination of the scenario developer.

The physics model should be able to handle multiple different media and exchanges of properties between these media so this might open it up to broader applications than fire-related stuff.
