pump operation simulator

The idea behind all of this is to create a simulation that can be used in various ways for training/staff development in fire services.
The physics model will ideally sit behind a range of scenarios with a diverse range of user interfaces adapted to the training need at hand.
This could include challenge-based pump panel operations, modelling supply overruns at complex incidents, articles with interactive elements, and interactive schematics for understanding flow in and around a fire pump.
